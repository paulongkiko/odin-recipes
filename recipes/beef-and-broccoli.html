    <h2>Ingedients</h2>

    <h4>Beef and Broccoli</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Thinly Sliced Flank Steak</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Seasame Seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Stir Fry Sauce</h4>
        <li>Grated Fresh Ginger</li>
        <li>Hot Water</li>
        <li>Low Sodium Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Corn Starch</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Seasame Oil</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Prep: Start cooking white rice first so it's ready when the stir fry is done. Cover and freeze steak 30 minutes for easier slicing.</li>
        <li>Combine all stir fry sauce ingredients in a bowl, stir well to dissolve the sugar, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp oil.  Add broccoli florets and sauté 4-5 minutes, partially covered with lid, stirring or tossing several times until broccoli is bright green and crisp-tender then remove from pan. Tip: If you prefer softer broccoli, add 2 Tbsp water before covering with the lid and it will steam cook the broccoli.
        </li>
        <li>Increase heat to high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Add beef in a single layer and sauté 2 minutes per side or just until cooked through. Quickly pull out a piece to test for doneness.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce, reduce heat to medium/low and simmer 3-4 minutes. It will thicken. Add broccoli and stir to combine. Stir in 1-2 Tbsp water to thin the sauce if desired. Serve over white rice.</li>
    </ol>
